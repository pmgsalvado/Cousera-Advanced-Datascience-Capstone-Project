<h2>Telecom Churn, Kaggle Competition and Cousera-Advanced-Datascience-Capstone-Project</h2>

<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<p>I had to find project for the Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The structure of this project is divided into two  different jupyter notebook:</p>
<ol>  
  <li><b>Telecom_data_prep.ipynb</b>
    <p>In this notebook, a thorough exploration of the data is made as well as data cleaning, filling with missing values and saving the cleaned data into a new dataset to be used in the next notebook.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li><b>Analysis_data_cleaned.ipynb</b>
    <p>In this notebook, cleaned data is loaded. </p>
    <p>Features and Target are separated.</p>
    <p>Three "scenarios" considered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Imbalanced Data</li>
      <li>Balanced Data - <b>SMOTE</b></li>
      <li>Balanced Data - <b>SMOTE</b> and <b>RandomUnderSampling</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
